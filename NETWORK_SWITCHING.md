- **Mobile Menu:** Full network selector with chain details
- **Development Mode:** Debug tools in artist verification step

### ‚úÖ Smart Contract Multi-Chain Support

Your contracts are now configured for multi-chain deployment:
- **Current:** Polygon Amoy (Chain ID: 80002)
- **Ready for:** Any supported network

## üîß How to Deploy on New Networks

### 1. Deploy Your Contracts

Deploy your smart contracts (PAGSToken, MusicNFT, MusicNFTMetadata) on any supported network.

### 2. Add Contract Addresses

Update `src/constants/contracts/contracts.ts`:

```typescript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  // Polygon Amoy (Testnet) - Current deployment
  80002: {
    PAGSToken: "0xCCfBbca65c129381C367C67EcDC1271B880D1b05",
    MusicNFT: "0x2CC2287C9b72Bf2BDb194DF6Cac265d2BD3B2167",
    MusicNFTMetadata: "0xAD77708c10CF1E1975cB29280Af2139686439bDB",
  },
  
  // Add new networks here:
  1: { // Ethereum Mainnet
    PAGSToken: "0x...",
    MusicNFT: "0x...",
    MusicNFTMetadata: "0x...",
  },
  137: { // Polygon Mainnet
    PAGSToken: "0x...",
    MusicNFT: "0x...",
    MusicNFTMetadata: "0x...",
  },
  // ... more networks
}
```

### 3. That's It!

The app will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detect supported networks
- ‚úÖ Switch contract addresses based on current network
- ‚úÖ Show network switcher options
- ‚úÖ Handle unsupported network warnings

## üéÆ Using the Network Switcher

### Desktop Experience
1. Look for the network indicator in the header (next to theme toggle)
2. Click to open the dropdown
3. Select your desired network
4. Wallet will prompt to switch networks

### Mobile Experience
1. Open the mobile menu (hamburger icon)
2. Scroll down to the "Network" section
3. Select your desired network from the full interface
4. Wallet will prompt to switch networks

### Network States
- **‚úÖ Connected:** Green dot, network name visible
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Unsupported:** Warning icon, yellow highlight
- **üîÑ Switching:** Loading state during transition

## üß™ Testing the System

### Manual Testing
1. Connect your wallet
2. Try switching between different networks
3. Observe how the app updates contract addresses
4. Test the artist signup flow on different networks
5. Verify the network switcher works on both desktop and mobile

### Debug Tools (Development Only)
- Visit the artist verification step
- Click "üîç Debug Contract" button
- Check contract deployment status on current network
- View detailed network and contract information

## üîç Technical Details

### Automatic Network Detection
The system automatically detects your current network and:
- Uses the correct contract addresses for that network
- Shows appropriate network information in the UI
- Warns when you're on an unsupported network

### Contract Address Resolution
```typescript
// Old way (single network)
const address = MUSIC_NFT_ADDRESS

// New way (multi-network)
const address = getContractAddress('MusicNFT', chainId)
```

### Error Handling
- **Contract not deployed:** Clear error message with instructions
- **Network switching fails:** User-friendly error with retry options
- **Unsupported network:** Visual warnings and guidance

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Production Deployment
1. Deploy contracts on desired mainnets
2. Add contract addresses to the configuration
3. Test thoroughly on each network
4. Update environment variables for production RPC endpoints

### Recommended Deployment Order
1. **Start with:** Polygon Mainnet (low fees, good user base)
2. **Add:** Base Mainnet (growing ecosystem, Coinbase backing)
3. **Consider:** Ethereum Mainnet (maximum reach, higher fees)
4. **Expand to:** Arbitrum, Optimism, etc. based on user demand

## üéØ Pro Tips

- **Test on testnets first** before mainnet deployment
- **Monitor gas costs** on different networks
- **Consider user base** for each network
- **Keep contract addresses updated** in your deployment scripts
- **Use the debug tools** to verify deployments
