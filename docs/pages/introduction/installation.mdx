# Installation [Getting started with dAppBooster in just a few minutes]

## dAppBooster's installation script

:::info
**Requirements**

- Node v20+ from https://nodejs.org/
- pnpm from https://pnpm.io/
- For Windows users the tested and recommended way is using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). There are no guarantees that using `bash` or other terminals will work.
:::

::::steps
### Run the script
Get a clean instance of the starter-kit by running this command.

You can select between several configuration options for your installation, remove optional packages, etc. Choose what you need for your particular project.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dlx dappbooster
```

### Change the remote (optional)
After you're finished with the installation, you might want to change your project's remote repository to a different one.

```bash [Terminal]
git remote set-url origin <your-repository-url>
```

### Running the dApp

To run the dApp in dev mode use this command and open the link provided in your browser.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev
```

You can start modifying the content of the home page by editing `src/components/pageComponents/home/index.tsx`, the page auto-updates as you edit the file.

:::info
**Additional configuration**

Check `.env.local` and `.env.example` for additional configurations, most vars are self-explanatory.
:::

## A note regarding subgraphs

There are no additional configuration requirements for the most part but **if you opted-in for subgraph support**, you'll need to provide the required environment vars in `.env.local` for the subgraph features to work.

:::warning
**Values for the mandatory subgraph env vars**

You can use the default values from most of the vars you'll  find in our `.env.example` file, but **you have to provide your own subgraph API key** (otherwise the dApp will not work). You can get one at https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/
:::

```sh [.env.local]
# Subgraph API key
PUBLIC_SUBGRAPHS_API_KEY='Your API key'
# Environment
PUBLIC_SUBGRAPHS_ENVIRONMENT='production'
# comma separated list of <chainId>:<subgraphId>:<resourceId>
PUBLIC_SUBGRAPHS_CHAINS_RESOURCE_IDS=''

# URLs for the subgraphs in development and production
# must have the replaceable strings [apiKey], [resourceId], and optionally [subgraphId]
PUBLIC_SUBGRAPHS_DEVELOPMENT_URL=''
PUBLIC_SUBGRAPHS_PRODUCTION_URL=''

```

:::warning
**Code generation**

After you added your API key and the other subgraph variables, don't forget to run the code generator.
:::

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm subgraph-codegen
```

:::info
**More about subgraphs**

Read more about using subgraphs in the [subraph recipe](/recipes/subgraphs) and [subgraph plugin](/advanced/subgraph-plugin) sections.

## Warming engines

And that's it!

We recommend starting with the [My first dApp recipe](/recipes/my-first-dapp) to see how easy it is to build a dApp with our starter kit. In just five minutes, this guide will show you how to create a dApp that lets you wrap and unwrap WETH on the Sepolia network. This hands-on introduction is an excellent first step to using dappBooster and getting familiar with its components.
