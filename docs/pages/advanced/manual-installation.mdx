# Manual Installation

## Overview

In case the installation script doesn't fit your needs these are the steps to perform a manual installation.

It's also the recommended procedure in case you're a **dAppBooster** developer.

::::steps
### Clone the repo

```bash [Terminal]
git clone git@github.com:BootNodeDev/dAppBooster.git dAppName
```

### Move into the folder

```bash [Terminal]
cd dAppName
```

### Branch checkout

The default branch is `develop`, which is fine if you're developing new features or fixing bugs, but if you're developing a new product you probably want to checkout the production-ready `main` branch:

```bash [Terminal]
git checkout main
```

Or you can get the last tag (usually, but not always, in sync with `main`), which is what the install script does.

```bash [Terminal]
# fetch tags
git fetch --tags
# get the last tag
git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)
# create a new branch from the tag
git checkout -b new-branch
```

### Create the .env file

Now move into the project's folder and create a `.env.local` file.

```bash [Terminal]
cd dAppBooster
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Install the dependencies

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm i
```

This will install **everything** by default, so you'll have to configure and run a few things to get your app running: most importantly, you **have to add a subgraph [API key](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/)**, provide all the subgraph-related env vars and then run the code generator. Otherwise the app will not work.

Check [this section](/introduction/installation#a-note-regarding-subgraphs) for extra info about configuring subgraphs and running the code generator.

:::tip
**Uninstalling subgraph support**

Optionally you can uninstall everything subgraph related, check the [info below](#subgraphs) to see how.

### Run the app
Now you can run the dApp in dev mode and open the link provided by this command in the browser.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev
```
::::

## Optional packages

There are plenty of optional packages you can remove (tip: the installation script does this for you). We think these are useful and make for a better result and developer experience, but you might think different.

Keep reading if you want to remove some or all of these packages.

### Subgraphs

If you don't need subgraph support, remove these packages:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove @bootnodedev/db-subgraph graphql graphql-request @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-typed-document-node/core
```

Also consider removing the related files and folders: `src/subgraph`, `src/components/pageComponents/home/Examples/demos/subgraphs` and the references in `/src/components/pageComponents/home/Examples/index.tsx`

Finally remove the subgraph-related scripts from `package.json`

### Typedoc

If you don't need [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/):

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove typedoc typedoc-github-theme typedoc-plugin-inline-sources typedoc-plugin-missing-exports typedoc-plugin-rename-defaults
```

And remove the `typedoc.json` file, `typedoc` folder, and related scripts from `package.json`

### Vocs

If you don't need [Vocs](https://vocs.dev/):

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove vocs
```

And remove the `vocs.config.ts` file, `docs` folder, and related scripts from `package.json`

### Husky

If you don't need [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/):

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove husky
```

And remove the `.husky` folder and related scripts from `package.json`

:::warning
**Git hooks**

[commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) are run by Husky's Git hooks, so you might consider removing them. You can run the scripts manually if you prefer to keep the packages, though.
:::

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional lint-staged
```

### Biome

If you don't need [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/):

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove @biomejs/biome
```

And remove the `biome.json` file and related scripts from `package.json`

### Vercel analytics

If you don't need [Vercel analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart):

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove @vercel/analytics
```

And remove the `Analytics` import and tag in `src/routes/__root.tsx`

### Testing

If you don't need automated testing:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @vitest/coverage-v8
```

And remove the `setupTests.ts` file, all the `*.test.tsx` and `*.test.ts` files, and related scripts from `package.json`

### Sitemap

If you don't need a sitemap:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm remove vite-plugin-sitemap
```

And remove all references from `vite.config.ts`

### Installation script

Remove the `.install-files` folder.
