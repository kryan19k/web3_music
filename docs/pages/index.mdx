## Why dAppBooster

dAppBooster is a [repository template](https://github.com/BootNodeDev/dAppBooster), a starter-kit for boosting the development of decentralized applications (dApps). It is built onto the last tools available such us [React](https://react.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [viem](https://viem.sh/), [@tanstank-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [@tanstank-query](https://tanstack.com/router/latest), [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Learn more about the [stack](/advanced/stack).

This template provides developers with a solid foundation, including essential configurations and tools for integrating with blockchain networks. By using [dAppBooster](https://demo.dappbooster.dev/), developers can quickly scaffold new dApps with a standardized setup, ensuring best practices for security, scalability, and efficiency are embedded from the start.

It includes a ready-to-use development environment and whether you're building DeFi apps, or other blockchain solutions, dAppBooster saves time making it easier to launch robust blockchain-based applications.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced blockchain developer, dAppBooster provides a reliable, scalable starting point that takes care of much of the initial setup, letting you focus on building unique features for your dApp. Its flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of blockchain-based applications, from simple token systems to complex decentralized ecosystems.


After more than five years of making decentralized apps, our team at [BootNode](https://bootnode.dev) has put
together a simple yet powerful  toolkit. This toolkit is designed to tackle the common hurdles and big decisions
that  come up when building dApps. It makes starting a new dApp smoother, cutting down on both time and complexity
while  focusing on developer experience, stability, bundle size, and performance. Here are some main features this
starter-kit provides:

- **Structure:** a flexible structure to handle contracts, ABIS, subgraphs and common decentralized components.
- **Multi-chain:** native support and configuration to work with multiple chains with automatic type safe and super intuitive.
- **Wallets connectivity:** native support to work with [connectkit](https://docs.family.co/connectkit), [rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/), [web3modal](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal).
- **Decentralized components:** Tree-shakable components that any dApp needs.
- **Subgraphs:** multi-chain subgraphs support with auto generated typed hooks to query data.
